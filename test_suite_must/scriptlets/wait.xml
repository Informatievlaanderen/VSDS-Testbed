            Use of SimulatedMessaging and a hidden "receive" step is a bit non-intuitive but it is due to the lack of
            a proper "delay" step that would be a processing step. We use "SimulatedMessaging" here as this is 
            currently the only way of applying an arbitrary delay to a test session (in the correct way - adding something
            like a Thread.sleep() in a test service is blocking operation that should be avoided).

            The good thing about hiding this in a scriptlet is that the way the delay is implemented is hidden from the rest
            of the test cases and need only be replaced in one spot if needed.
