# SPEC Conform:
# VOCAB-DCAT-2 is the standard for Open Data Portals by W3C.
# In order to find TREE compliant datasets in data portals,
# there SHOULD be a dcat:accessURL from the dcat:Distribution to the entrypoint where the tree:Collections are described.
# Furthermore, there SHOULD be a dct:conformsTo this URI: https://w3id.org/tree.
#
# Verify: the LDES server root lists all tree:Collections and tree:Views and that the corresponding view descriptions
# include a dct:conformsTo property with the value https://w3id.org/tree.
